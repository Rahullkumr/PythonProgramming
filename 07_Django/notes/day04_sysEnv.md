## System Environment

- The environment where we install and store softwares, packages globally.

- sir, If I create a folder in C drive or D drive and install some softwares or store some files in it. Will that folder be called system environment for that installed softwares? Can we say a folder is also a system environment?
    
    - NO, a folder is not a system environment.

- problem: After some time if we update python then old projects will not work because of new features. so Sys Env is not good

## visualize sys env
