2. Thread based
    each task is an independent part of the same program
    most commonly used type of multitasking

    only one program/only one process
    within the same process, multiple parts are executing simultaneously

THREAD:
    An independent part of program
    A flow of execution is considered as a thread
    It is a python object
    For every thread independent job is available/assigned

Adv of multithreading:
    reduce execution time and improve performance

when should we go for multithreading?
    whenever there is a group of independent jobs to be executed

Applications:
    animations
    multimedia graphics
    video games
    web servers and application servers
