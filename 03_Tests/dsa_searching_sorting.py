# Basic Binary Search
# Question:
# Implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target element in a sorted array.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], target = 7
# •	Output: 3 (index of 7)
#
#
# Binary Search for the Last Occurrence
# Question:
# Modify the binary search to return the index of the last occurrence of the target in the sorted array.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 3
# •	Output: 3 (index of the last occurrence of 3)
#
#
#
# Basic Linear Search
# Question:
# Implement a basic linear search algorithm to find the index of a target element in an unsorted array.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [10, 15, 20, 25], target = 20
# •	Output: 2 (since 20 is at index 2)
#
# Linear Search - Find Maximum Element
# Question:
# Write a linear search algorithm to find the maximum element in an unsorted list.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [4, 8, 2, 9, 5]
# •	Output: 9 (since 9 is the largest element)
#
#
# Basic Bubble Sort Implementation
# Question:
# Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

#
# Bubble Sort - Sort in Descending Order
# Question:
# Modify the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
# •	Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]
#
#
# Basic Selection Sort
# Question:
# Implement the basic selection sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
# •	Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
#
# Selection Sort - Sort in Descending Order
# Question:
# Modify the selection sort algorithm to sort an array in descending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
# •	Output: [64, 25, 22, 12, 11]
#
# Basic Insertion Sort
# Question:
# Implement the basic insertion sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
# •	Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
#
# Insertion Sort - Sort in Descending Order
# Question:
# Modify the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array in descending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
# •	Output: [13, 12, 11, 6, 5]
#
#
# Basic Quick Sort
# Question:
# Implement the basic quick sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
# Example:
# •	Input: arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
# •	Output: [1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#
# Quick Sort - Sort in Descending Order
